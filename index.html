                              The word <i>Quantum</i> is a label for the rules that describe all behavior in the universe, so far as humanity knows.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">Often, the conversation about quantum rules starts with a lot of imagination and mathematics. The lesson
                              plans on this page offer a different approach. We hope that you can use them to help your students build an intuition
                              about two fundamental concepts in modern quantum physics:
                            <ul>
                              <li><b>Quantum superposition</b>: a property of quantum objects that allows them to exist in multiple states, or
                                universes,
                                at the same time.</li>
                              <li><b>Quantum entanglement</b>: the ability to link two or more quantum objects in a way that transcends space and
                                time.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">Those concepts describe the world around us, but they've been hidden from us until recently. Researchers
                              at labs around the world are now learning how to create and wield quantum phenomena at our everyday, macroscopic
                              scales. This work is the foundation for a new kind of super-powerful computer: a quantum computer.</p>
                            <p class="lead">The activities are independent, so you can use either activity, or both, in any order. We recommend that
                              you start
                              with the Quantum Chess puzzles.</p>

                            <h3>Overview for the instructor</h3>
                            <div>
                              <p>Chess has a reputation for being a game played by elite intellectuals. This activity uses the chess board as a tool
                                to help students build intuition about otherwise abstract concepts. For the purpose of this activity, think of the
                                chess board and pieces as just common, physical objects. The chess pieces move on the board according to a simple
                                set of rules.</p>

                              <p>We hope that the students can imagine themselves touching the chess pieces. We use this sense of cognitive
                                embodiment to support the idea that a system can be in more than one state with some probability. Rather than
                                imagine a single board, ask your students to imagine multiple boards where a single piece can occupy a different
                                square on each board.</p>

                              <img src="assets/lessons/rook_in_superposition.svg"
                                alt="A rook in superposition, flanked by each possible reality of the rook." />

                              <p>The animated character in the activity (Sphero )introduces the chess board and some basic moves. Sphero goes on to
                                present a set of puzzles, where the students need to move a small set of chess pieces on a small region of the
                                board, for a specific objective (capture, help your piece escape capture, and so on).
                              </p>

                              <p>The puzzles offer an opportunity to enable students to consider the principles of quantum mechanics in an intuitive
                                way. Almost everyone finds the mathematics of quantum mechanics unintuitive, at first. For those who go on to study
                                quantum mechanics more deeply, we hope that the intuition that they build with this activity could provide a
                                stronger foundation on which to build more thorough knowledge about the mathematics that define quantum mechanics.
                                We hope that this activity makes their journey simpler and easier.

                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>You can use this script before the first lesson:</p>
                            <div class="lesson-script">
                                <p>Today we are going to explore an exciting branch of physics called Quantum physics. Quantum physics usually deals
                                  with things that are very very small, like particles and atoms. This level is called the Quantum Realm. It's not a
                                  different place; it's a different way of looking at why things are the way that they are. Things are different down at
                                  that level. </p>
                                <p>One amazing aspect of the Quantum Realm is that it predicts the existence of many parallel universes, where things
                                  can be very different from our universe. For example, there may be a universe in which dinosaurs still roam the Earth,
                                  or even ones in which time travel and teleportation have already been developed.</p>
                                <p>The idea that we may be living in just one of many universes - a multiverse - may sound unbelievable, like something
                                  out of science fiction. Still, it’s something that many quantum physicists believe to be true, and are currently
                                  researching.
                                </p>
                                <p>If you’ve heard of the Marvel superhero Ant Man, then you’ve already been introduced to the Quantum Realm! Ant Man
                                  wears a special suit that allows him to enter the Quantum Realm and harness its power.</p>
                                <p>In fact, scientists at universities like Caltech and companies like Google, are looking for ways to manifest the
                                  powers of the Quantum Realm at the human scale. This would open a world of possibilities for the future of science and
                                  humanity, and we’re going to learn more about it!</p>
                                <p>Today our goal is to understand the power of two important concepts in Quantum physics: quantum superposition and
                                  quantum entanglement. These two concepts are responsible for everything we see in the Quantum Realm. </p>
                                <p>Raise your hand if you have played chess before or seen Queen’s Gambit? We are going to see the power of
                                  superposition and entanglement through a set of chess puzzles that you can explore on your own. It's a version of
                                  chess with a Quantum twist! </p>
                                <p>Through the game we will learn more about how things work in the Quantum Realm. We will learn about a concept called
                                  quantum superposition, which is when something can exist in multiple places at the same time. We will also learn about
                                  another amazing power hiding within the quantum realm: quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement is so powerful, it
                                  is thought to connect all of space and time, including how the multiverse itself is stitched together.</p>
                                <p>When you go to this link on your device, you will be directed through a series of puzzles. These puzzles apply the
                                  laws of quantum physics to the classic game of chess. You don’t need to know how to play chess to enjoy the game.</p>

                            <h3>Strategy reflection</h3>
                            <p>One of the core activities of quantum information scientists is to uncover and express the behaviors of systems in
                              terms of quantum physics. A quantum chemist might look at the electric structure of atoms and molecules and try to
                              describe them in terms of possible realities that interact with each other. If they're successful, they can program a
                              quantum computer (when they become more useful) to do things like create new proteins and predict the result of
                              complex chemical reactions.</p>
                            <p>The Quantum Chess puzzles prompt students to start building this habit of thinking about systems in terms of their
                              possible states, and how those states depend on each other. Puzzles 7 through 11, in particular, encourage students to
                              explore the interactions of multiple realities.
                            </p>
                            <p>The strategy to solve these puzzles depends on students acquiring some familiarity with the quantum "moves" used in
                              the puzzles:
                            </p>
                            <table class="table" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
                              <tr>
                                <th>Move</th>
                                <th>Description</th>
                              </tr>
                              <tr>
                                <td>Split</td>
                                <td>Put a piece in quantum superposition. In isolation, you can think of a piece in superposition as a single piece
                                  on different squares on different boards (realities). A single split would create two boards, each with 50%
                                  probability of being the board in your reality. If you split one of your two pieces again, you would have three
                                  boards (realities):
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Board 1: 50% probability.</li>
                                    <li>Board 2: 25% probability.</li>
                                    <li>Board 3: 25% probability.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                  If you can imagine the three boards, you can start to think through the relationships between them.
                                  </td>
                                  </tr>
                                  <tr>
                                    <td>Entanglement</td>
                                    <td>The simplest way to create quantum entanglement is to move a piece through another piece that is in
                                      superposition. In this case your piece is entangled with the other piece, which means that the fate of your piece
                                      depends on the state of the other piece. If you are in the reality where the piece was in your way, your piece
                                      didn't move, and vice versa. Again, this should prompt some reflection about:
                                      <ul>
                                    <li>How different realities relate to each other.</li>
                                    <li>What kind of information is encoded in the state of the board.</li>
                                    <li>And so on.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                  <td>Measurement</td>
                                  <td>Two pieces of different types can't occupy the same square. If you move your piece into the same square as a
                                    different piece, you force the game to measure the state of that square. Measurement tells you which realities are
                                    compatible with the outcome observed. In the game, this eliminates some, or most, of the possible realities
                                    (depending on their relationships).</td>
                                </tr>
                                </table>

                                <p>Puzzles 10 and 11 are great examples of how some choices about the system drive very different outcomes. In both
                                  puzzles the same initial move yields very different possible outcomes, depending on the King's response.</p>
                                <p>The near King (square F1), cannot take the Rook under any circumstances. In mathematical terms, there is a zero
                                  percent chance of success. Why? For the Rook to land on square G1, it would need to pass through the square F1. If the
                                  King were on square F1, the Rook would not have moved. So, the Rook on G1 is entangled with the King on F1 (we've
                                  created one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state">Bell states</a>).</p>
                                <p>However, that doesn't guarantee success for the King on square H1. Since the King is in superposition, the system has
                                  two possible states. If the King from H1 tries to capture the Rook on G1, we trigger our Measurement rule (two
                                  different pieces try to occupy the same square). If the King is truly on H1, then:
                                </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>The King was not on square F1.</li>
                              <li>The Rook passed through square F1 to reach G1.</li>
                              <li>The King captures G1 from H1.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>However, the measurement could have told us that we were in the other reality, where the King was on F1. In this
                              case, the Rook never reached G1, so the Rook is safe.
                            </p>
                            <p>While Quantum Chess is just a game, it enables the player to start building intuition about quantum behaviors that
                              one can go on to apply in other contexts.

                            <p>In a standard Magic Square game, a player is given 9 numbers and a 3 by 3 grid. The task is to fill in the grid with the numbers so that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to a single number. Solutions exist to solve the Magic Square.</p>

                            <p>In the Quantum Magic Square game, the goal is for two groups to coordinate the placement of the numbers 1 and 0 in their column and row, in a pattern so that both groups choose the same number where the one's row and the other's column intersect.</p>
                            <p>The Blue group must populate the rows of the grid with an even number of ones. The Red group must populate the columns with an odd number of Zeros.</p>

                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>You can use this script before the first lesson:</p>
                            <div class="lesson-script">

                              <p>Today we are going to explore an exciting branch of physics called Quantum physics. Quantum physics usually deals
                                with things that are very very small, like particles and atoms. This level is called the Quantum Realm. It's not a
                                different place; it's a different way of looking at why things are the way that they are. Things are different down
                                at
                                that level. </p>

                              <p>One amazing aspect of the Quantum Realm is that it predicts the existence of many parallel universes, where things
                                can be very different from our universe. For example, there may be a universe in which dinosaurs still roam the
                                Earth,
                                or even ones in which time travel and teleportation have already been developed.</p>

                              <p>The idea that we may be living in just one of many universes - a multiverse - may sound unbelievable, like
                                something
                                out of science fiction. Still, it’s something that many quantum physicists believe to be true, and are currently
                                researching.</p>

                              <p>If you’ve heard of the Marvel superhero Ant Man, then you’ve already been introduced to the Quantum Realm! Ant Man
                                wears a special suit that allows him to enter the Quantum Realm and harness its power.</p>

                              <p>In fact, scientists at universities like Caltech and companies like Google, are looking for ways to manifest the
                                powers of the Quantum Realm at the human scale. This would open a world of possibilities for the future of science
                                and
                                humanity, and we’re going to learn more about it!</p>

                            <p>If this is their first lesson, you can continue:</p>

                                    Today our goal is to understand the power of two important concepts in Quantum physics:
                                    <b>quantum superposition</b>
                                    and
                                    <b>quantum entanglement</b>
                                    . These two concepts are be responsible we see in the Quantum Realm. We’re going to start by playing a game together.
                                    It’s a fairly simple game called Zeroes and Ones. I’m going to play a video so all you need to do is follow along.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>If they’ve already done the chess puzzles lesson, you can continue:</p>
                            <div class="lesson-script">
                                <p>
                                    In the previous lesson, you learned about
                                    <b>quantum superposition</b>
                                    and
                                    <b>quantum entanglement</b>
                                    through the game of quantum chess. Remember: quantum superposition is when something can exist in multiple states at the
                                    same time. Today we are going to continue to see the power of superposition and entanglement through another game that
                                    we’re all going to play together.

                            <p>To win the game, every row needs an even number of 1s and every column needs an odd number of 1s. However, there's always one square that can't be filled in without breaking the rules. This means that there is only an 8/9 chance of winning any given round, or about 89%.</p>
                            <img alt="Ideal strategy" src="assets/lessons/ideal-strategy.svg" style="width: 260px" />
                            <p>We can write the probability for any one team winning four rounds in a row:</p>
                            <div class="mathjax">$$p = \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^4 \approx 62.43\%$$</div>
                            <p>Or, more generally, for winning n games in a row:</p>
                            <div class="mathjax">$$p = \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^n$$</div>
                            <p>Now we can write the probability of at least three groups winning all four rounds:</p>
                            <img id="probability" alt="Equation" src="assets/lessons/probability.svg" alt="p to the power of 4 plus 4 left parenthesis 1 minus p right parenthesis p cubed space equals p to the power of 4 plus 4 p cubed minus 4 p to the power of 4 space equals 4 p cubed minus 3 p to the power of 4" />
                            <p>Earlier, we calculated that the probability of winning all four rounds was $$\left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^4$$, so substituting that into our equation:</p>
                            <div class="mathjax">$$4 \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^{4 \times 3} - 3 \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^{4 \times 4}$$</div>
                            <div class="mathjax">$$\approx 51.76\%$$</div>
                            <p>As we build machines that enable us to engage with the quantum realm, like quantum computers, we can play this game in a way where we win 100% of the time. For this game, we need a device with six qubits that we can entangle.</p>
