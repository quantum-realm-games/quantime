This activity emphasizes the limitations of classical physics of systems: an optimal strategy only enables a win ratio of 8/9. However, if the students have access to a quantum computer, the win ratio grows to 100%.</p>

                            <p>Students communicate that a quantum system can express the relationships between multiple configurations of classical, single-state systems (coins are either heads or tails, physical chess pieces are either on the board or not).</p>
                            <p>This is a feature of the real world as well, hidden from us until recently. Researchers at labs around the world are now learning how to create and wield quantum phenomena at our everyday, macroscopic scales. This work is the foundation for a new kind of super-powerful computer, quantum computers.</p>

                                <p>"Today we are going to explore an exciting branch of physics called Quantum physics. Quantum physics usually deals with things that are very very small, like particles and atoms. This level is called the Quantum Realm. Things are different down at that level. One amazing aspect of the Quantum Realm is that it predicts the existence of many parallel universes, where things can be very different from our universe. For example, there may be a universe in which dinosaurs still roam the Earth, or even ones in which time travel and teleportation have already been developed."</p>
                                <p>"The idea that we may be living in just one of many universes - a multiverse - may sound unbelievable, like something out of science fiction. Still, it’s something that many quantum physicists believe to be true, and are currently researching."</p>
                                <p>"If you’ve heard of the Marvel superhero Ant Man, then you’ve already been introduced to the Quantum Realm! Ant Man wears a special suit that allows him to enter the Quantum Realm and harness its power. Indeed, current research has revealed deep connections between fundamental aspects of the Quantum Realm and the nature of space and time."</p>
                                <p>"In fact, scientists at universities like Caltech and companies like Google, are looking for ways to manifest the powers of the Quantum Realm at the human scale. This would open a world of possibilities for the future of science and humanity, and we’re going to learn more about it today!""</p>

                            <p>In a standard Magic Square game, a player is given 9 numbers and a 3 by 3 grid. The task is to fill in the grid with the numbers so that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to a single number. Solutions exist to solve the Magic Square.</p>

                            <p>In the Quantum Magic Square game, the goal is for two groups to coordinate the placement of the numbers 1 and 0 in their column and row, in a pattern so that both groups choose the same number where the one's row and the other's column intersect.</p>
                            <p>The Blue group must populate the rows of the grid with an even number of ones. The Red group must populate the columns with an odd number of Zeros.</p>

                            <p>To win the game, every row needs an even number of 1s and every column needs an odd number of 1s. However, there's always one square that can't be filled in without breaking the rules. This means that there is only an 8/9 chance of winning any given round, or about 89%.</p>
                            <img alt="Ideal strategy" src="assets/lessons/ideal-strategy.svg" style="width: 260px" />
                            <p>We can write the probability for any one team winning four rounds in a row:</p>
                            <div class="mathjax">$$p = \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^4 \approx 62.43\%$$</div>
                            <p>Or, more generally, for winning n games in a row:</p>
                            <div class="mathjax">$$p = \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^n$$</div>
                            <p>Now we can write the probability of at least three groups winning all four rounds:</p>
                            <img id="probability" alt="Equation" src="assets/lessons/probability.svg" alt="p to the power of 4 plus 4 left parenthesis 1 minus p right parenthesis p cubed space equals p to the power of 4 plus 4 p cubed minus 4 p to the power of 4 space equals 4 p cubed minus 3 p to the power of 4" />
                            <p>Earlier, we calculated that the probability of winning all four rounds was $$\left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^4$$, so substituting that into our equation:</p>
                            <div class="mathjax">$$4 \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^{4 \times 3} - 3 \left( \frac{8}{9} \right)^{4 \times 4}$$</div>
                            <div class="mathjax">$$\approx 51.76\%$$</div>
                            <p>As we build machines that enable us to engage with the quantum realm, like quantum computers, we can play this game in a way where we win 100% of the time. For this game, we need a device with six qubits that we can entangle.</p>

                                following video describes how we can use these qubits to win the game.

                            <p>This outro is about connecting the quantum concepts the students learned about to the real world. Before leading this workshop, feel free to watch all of the videos and decide which would be most appropriate for your class, or ask the class to choose! We love them all so we couldn’t choose just one!</p>

                            <p>This video pits actor Paul Rudd (Marvel’s Ant Man) against theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking playing each other in an epic game of quantum chess.</p>
                            <p>This video can be watched after either lesson but we recommend showing it after the students have been introduced to the chess puzzles. It’s a bit long but serves as a fun note to end on. If there is not enough time, we recommend sending the link home with your students so they can watch it on their own time!</p>
                            <p>If the students are not familiar with Ant Man, explain that he is a Marvel superhero that has a special suit that makes him extremely tiny, allowing him to enter a tiny universe called the Quantum Realm. If the students are not familiar with Stephen Hawking, explain that he is a famous theoretical physicist, who tried to figure out the Theory of Everything - how gravity works at the quantum level.</p>

                            <p>There is so much more to learn about this topic that we weren’t able to cover in this lesson. The study of quantum physics is vast and ever-growing, and if you’d like to continue your journey with it, there are many ways:</p>
