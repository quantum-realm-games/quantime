                            <p>Students will communicate that a quantum system can express the relationships between multiple configurations of classical, single-state systems (coins are either heads or tails, physical chess pieces are either on the board or not).</p>
                            <p>This is a feature of the real world as well, hidden from us until recently. Researchers at labs around the world are now learning how to create and wield quantum phenomena at our everyday, macroscopic scales. This work is the foundation for a new kind of super-powerful computer, quantum computers.</p>

                                <li>Today we are going to explore an exciting branch of physics called Quantum physics. Quantum physics usually deals with things that are very very small, like particles and atoms. This level is called the Quantum Realm. Things are different down at that level. One amazing aspect of the Quantum Realm is that it predicts the existence of many parallel universes, where things can be very different from our universe. For example, there may be a universe in which dinosaurs still roam the Earth, or even ones in which time travel and teleportation have already been developed.</li>
                                <li>If you’ve heard of the Marvel superhero Antman, then you’ve already been introduced to the Quantum Realm! Antman wears a special suit that makes him extremely tiny, allowing him to enter a tiny universe called the Quantum Realm.</li>
                                <li>The idea that we may be living in just one of multiple universes - a multiverse - may sound unbelievable, like something out of science fiction. Still, it’s something that most quantum physicists believe to be true, and are currently researching. In fact, scientists at universities like Caltech and companies like Google, are looking for ways to manifest the powers of the Quantum Realm at the human scale. This would open a world of possibilities for the future of science and humanity, and we’re going to learn more about it today!</li>

                            <p>In a standard Magic Square game, a player is given 9 numbers and a 3 by 3 grid. The task is to fill in the grid with the numbers so that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to a single number. Solutions exist to solve the Magic Square.</p>
                            <img src="" alt="example image" />
                            <p>In the Quantum Magic Square game, the goal is for two teams to coordinate the placement of the numbers 1 and 0 in their column and row, in a pattern so that both teams choose the same number where the one's row and the other's column intersect.</p>
                            <img src="" alt="table: example images" />
                            <p>The dice introduce an element of chance that makes the Zeros and Ones game unwinnable if the game is played repeatedly.</p>
                            <p>However, if the students had access to a quantum system (like a quantum computer, or some other kind of "entangled qubit"), the quantum magic square game is winnable almost every time.</p>
                            <p>
                                In this game, the class divides into four teams, and plays against the instructor. A pre-recorded invigilator guides the entire class through the process. Alternatively, you can use the

                                to orient the class at your own pace.

These two concepts may be responsible for everything that exists in the universe. All of matter and light, all of space and time. We’re going to start by playing a game together. It’s a fairly simple game called Zeroes and Ones. I’m going to play a video so all you need to do is follow along.”</li>
